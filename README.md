# TeamLink

TeamLink is a simple but complete implementation of [SFMediaStream](https://github.com/ScarletsFiction/SFMediaStream). You can connect with your friends from anywhere, just from a link.

# Usage

Simply go to https://teamlink.tk/call/ and add any random string at the end.
(Ex. https://teamlink.tk/call/room1), and that's it. No need to even go to the website to start a call, just enter the link and we'll get it sorted for you.
